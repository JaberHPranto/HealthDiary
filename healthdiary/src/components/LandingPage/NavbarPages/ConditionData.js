        data: 'There are 2 main types of stroke: Ischemic stroke is the most common type of stroke, accounting for about 80% of all stroke cases.This can be an obstruction caused by a blood clot or piece of debris that forms in another area and travels along the bloodstream until it causes a blockage of an artery in the brain.An ischemic stroke can also be the result of the accumulation of fatty deposits and cholesterol in the arterial wall, which causes narrowing of the blood vessels and loss of flexibility, resulting in an inefficient transport of oxygen- rich blood to the brain.Hemorrhagic stroke accounts for about 20 % of stroke cases.The most common causes of hemorrhagic stroke are high blood pressure and brain aneurysms, as the weak or bulging area in the arterial wall balloons and eventually ruptures.It can also be caused by artery weakening or loss of flexibility due to accumulation of fat in the arteries, making them susceptible to breakage and rupture.This is very dangerous as it causes a sudden drop in blood supply to the brain, as well as bleeding within the brain, which can result in death in a very short period of time.',
        symptoms:"Symptoms of stroke include: Sudden numbness or weakness of the face and/or limbs, especially on one side of the body,Slurred speech, crooked smile or drooping mouth corner, drooling and difficulty swallowing,Headache, sudden dizziness,Blurred vision, double or blackened vision, or sudden loss of vision on one side of the visual field,rouble with walking, loss of balance or coordination"

       label:'Coronary Artery Disease',
       value:'chck2',
       data:'Coronary artery disease is the result of a buildup of plaque around the interior wall of the arteries, causing the lining of the arteries to thicken and become constricted. When this happens, the heart can’t pump as much oxygenated blood as required. Over time, if a patient develops coronary artery disease, his or her blood vessels will no longer be able to supply sufficient oxygenated blood to the heart muscle, which can lead to sudden and severe chest pains or heart attack. If there is a sudden blockage of the arteries caused by deposits of plaque, a rupture or a blood clot may then develop, resulting in a potentially fatal heart attack and other serious related complications.',
       symptoms: 'A crushing pain in the chest is a typical symptom of coronary heart disease: the pain is severe, and is often likened to a heavy load being placed on top of you, or being squeezed around the chest or underneath the sternum. You may also experience a pain in the neck, jaw, shoulders and arms, especially on your left side, and particularly during exercise, lasting for around 2-3 minutes. When seated, or when taking medication to dilute the blood vessels under the tongue (also known as nitrates), the symptoms should improve.'

        label:'Heart Attack (Myocardial Infarction)',
        value:'chck3',
        data:"A heart attack is caused by the formation of a blood clot in a coronary artery. When the body's cholesterol levels are too high, it causes deposits of fatty substances known as plaque to build up along the interior walls of the blood vessels. These deposits also contain white blood cells, which build up inside the lining of the blood vessels instead of circulating around the body. Over time, these fatty deposits will rupture or split, and the blood vessel will try to repair itself by forming a blood clot, which then further constricts the surrounding blood vessels. If a rupture occurs in a small blood vessel, the patient may only experience chest pain. However, if the blood clot forms in a large blood vessel such as a coronary artery, it can result in death.",
        symptoms:'Tight chest pain; as if a heavy object has been placed on the chest, especially across the middle of the chest, with the pain lasting for more than one minute,Shooting pain which travels up to the neck, jaw, shoulders, and arms on both sides,Sweating,Feeling tired easily / fatigue,Shortness of breath,Dizziness,Fainting,Rapid heartbeat'

        data:'There are 2 main types of pneumonitis: Infectious Pneumonitis aka Pneumonia – A lung infection that causes inflammation and swelling of the air sacs in the lungs. The type of infection can vary, and may include viruses, bacteria, and fungi. Bacterial infections include Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenza type B, Chlamydia pneumoniae, Legionella spp., and Mycoplasma pneumoniae, while viral infections include respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and the influenza virus. Non-Infectious Pneumonitis – This occurs from, for example, inhaling substances or toxins that irritate the lungs. Such substances include smoke, dust, and some volatile chemicals. Additionally, certain (few) antibiotics, chemotherapy drugs, and anti-arrhythmic medications can also produce pneumonitis.',
